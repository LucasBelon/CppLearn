/*Create a four-function calculator for fraction
 * . (See Exercise 9 in Chapter 2, and Exercise
 * 4 in this chapter.) Here are the formulas for
 * the four arithmetic operations applied to fractions:
 *
 * Addition:       a/b + c/d = (a*d + b*c) / (b*d)
 * Subtraction:    a/b - c/d = (a*d - b*c) / (b*d)
 * Multiplication: a/b * c/d = (a*c) / (b*d)
 * Division:       a/b / c/d = (a*d) / (b*c)
 *
 * The user should type the first fraction, an
 * operator, and a second fraction. The program
 * should then display the result and ask whether
 * the user wants to continue.*/
